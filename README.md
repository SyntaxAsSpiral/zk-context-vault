# Context Vault

*A comprehensive cognitive infrastructure for AI-augmented development and knowledge work.*

## What This Is

This is not just documentation. It's a **cognitive infrastructure**—a systematic approach to context engineering, agent systems, and knowledge management that transforms how you work with AI. The vault provides the foundational patterns, tools, and frameworks needed to build sophisticated AI-augmented workflows while maintaining epistemic hygiene and assumption-hostile design.

Think of it as "the missing manual for working with AI systems at scale."

## The Architecture

The vault operates through six integrated systems that form a complete cognitive stack:

```
Principles → Skills → Agents → Prompts → Workshop → Exocortex
     ↓         ↓        ↓        ↓         ↓         ↓
Foundation → Capabilities → Identity → Cognition → Assembly → Memory
```

### Core Systems

| System | Purpose | Key Insight | Integration |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **[Principles](principles.md)** | Anti-assumption framework | Every yama guards against a presumption | Foundation for all other systems |
| **[Skills](skills/README.md)** | Technical capabilities library | Dual-format documentation enables multiple deployment targets | Workshop compilation sources |
| **[Agents](agents/README.md)** | Kiro-specific configurations | Modular context assembly with explicit behavior control | Identity and workflow management |
| **[Prompts](prompts/README.md)** | Epistemic rendering stack | Same content through different cognitive lenses | Cognitive transformation toolkit |
| **[Workshop](workshop/README.md)** | Recipe-based assembly system | Write once, deploy everywhere via slice architecture | Context compilation and deployment |
| **[Exocortex](exocortex/README.md)** | Pentadyadic agent architecture | Distributed cognition through specialized AI agents | Advanced multi-agent coordination |

## The Cognitive Stack

### Layer 1: Foundational Principles

The [Covenant Principles](principles.md) provide the philosophical foundation—an anti-assumption framework that prevents the cardinal sin of presumption. Every principle guards against a specific assumption that leads to cognitive failure.

**Key Insight**: Assumptions are the root cause of AI system failures. Explicit principles create assumption-hostile design.

### Layer 2: Technical Capabilities

The [Skills Library](skills/README.md) provides comprehensive technical documentation with dual-format support for multiple deployment targets (Claude Code, Codex, Kiro Powers). Each skill follows consistent patterns while maintaining deployment flexibility.

**Key Insight**: Write once, deploy everywhere. Consistent documentation patterns enable automated compilation.

### Layer 3: Agent Identity & Workflow

The [Agent System](agents/README.md) documents universal patterns for AI coding agent configuration: structured development processes, hierarchical steering, and modular context assembly. These patterns work across different platforms (Kiro, Claude Code, Codex, Charm) while maintaining consistent cognitive workflows.

**Key Insight**: Explicit configuration prevents black-box behavior. Platform-agnostic patterns enable consistent workflows across different AI coding environments.

### Layer 4: Cognitive Transformation

The [Epistemic Rendering Stack](prompts/README.md) provides different cognitive lenses for exploring the same concepts—from gentle bedtime stories to heated philosophical dialectics. Each lens reveals different aspects of truth.

**Key Insight**: No single cognitive approach captures complete truth. Multiple lenses preserve meaning through multiplicity.

### Layer 5: Assembly & Deployment

The [Workshop System](workshop/README.md) uses recipe-based compilation to assemble context from distributed sources. The slice architecture enables modular composition with target-specific formatting.

**Key Insight**: Context assembly should be explicit and reproducible. Recipes enable version control for cognitive artifacts.

### Layer 6: Advanced Coordination

The [Exocortex Architecture](exocortex/README.md) implements sophisticated multi-agent coordination through the pentadyadic pattern—five specialized agents working in coordinated evaluation and synthesis.

**Key Insight**: Distributed cognition requires explicit coordination protocols. Specialization enables capabilities beyond single-agent limits.

## Integration Patterns

### Cross-System Coherence

The systems maintain coherence through several mechanisms:

- **Slice Architecture**: Consistent `<!-- slice:type=identifier -->` markers enable modular composition
- **Workshop Recipes**: Automated assembly from distributed sources with target-specific formatting
- **Steering Hierarchy**: Global → Workspace → Project context inheritance
- **Principle Enforcement**: Covenant principles guide design decisions across all systems

### Deployment Targets

The vault supports multiple deployment scenarios:

| Target | Source Systems | Assembly Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Claude Code** | Skills + Agents | Workshop recipes | Technical skill deployment |
| **Kiro Powers** | Skills + Prompts | Power packaging | User-friendly capabilities |
| **Exocortex Agents** | All systems | Slice extraction | Advanced multi-agent coordination |
| **Documentation** | All systems | Cross-linking | Knowledge management and discovery |

## Operational Philosophy

### Bespoke-First Design

Following the [Bespoke Principle](principles.md#✨-bespokedness), the vault optimizes for operator workflow over enterprise patterns. When rewrite takes an hour, optimize for beauty and razor-sharp function over long-term maintainability.

### Assumption-Hostile Architecture

Every component explicitly guards against assumptions. The [Data Fidelity Principle](principles.md#🗣️-data-fidelity) ensures UNKNOWN > INVENTED. Missing information triggers queries rather than presumptive behavior.

### Context Hygiene

The [Context Hygiene Principle](principles.md#🧬-context-hygiene) prevents context-stuffing and wholesale transmission. Context is compiled per-recipient and per-turn, maintaining clean cognitive boundaries.

### Work Preservation

The [Work Preservation Principle](principles.md#⛔-work-preservation) ensures nothing gets lost. Changes are explicit and reversible. "Out of scope" triggers questions, not automatic cleanup.

## Getting Started

### For Context Engineering
1. Start with [Context Fundamentals](skills/context-fundamentals/SKILL.md)
2. Explore [Context Optimization](skills/context-optimization/SKILL.md) techniques
3. Implement [Progressive Disclosure](skills/context-fundamentals/SKILL.md#progressive-disclosure) patterns

### For Agent Development
1. Review [Agent Roles](agents/agent-roles.md) for identity patterns
2. Configure [Kiro Hooks](agents/kiro-hooks.md) for workflow automation
3. Implement [3-Phase Specs](agents/kiro-specs.md) for structured development

### For Cognitive Work
1. Explore [Epistemic Rendering](prompts/README.md) approaches
2. Use [Workshop Recipes](workshop/README.md) for context assembly
3. Consider [Multi-Agent Patterns](skills/multi-agent-patterns/SKILL.md) for complex tasks

### For Advanced Coordination
1. Study [Exocortex Architecture](exocortex/README.md) patterns
2. Implement [Memory Systems](skills/memory-systems/SKILL.md) for persistence
3. Design [Evaluation Frameworks](skills/evaluation/SKILL.md) for quality assurance

## The Vault Advantage

This cognitive infrastructure solves fundamental problems in AI-augmented work:

- **No Black Boxes**: Every behavior is explicitly configured and documented
- **Assumption Resistance**: Principles prevent presumptive failures
- **Modular Composition**: Slice architecture enables flexible assembly
- **Multiple Deployment**: Write once, deploy to multiple targets
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: Multiple lenses reveal different aspects of truth
- **Workflow Integration**: Systems work together rather than in isolation

The result is AI assistance that enhances rather than replaces human cognition, maintaining transparency and control while providing sophisticated capabilities.
