# Hook Prompts

Markdown sources for Kiro hook creation via UI. These are the editable prompt texts that get used to create `.kiro.hook` JSON configurations.

**Canonical hook configs:** `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` (this vault serves as canonical source)

**Deployment pattern:** Workshop recipes can deploy hooks from this vault's `.kiro/hooks/` to project-specific `.kiro/` directories.

These are the canonical editable texts for hook-style prompts (not the `.kiro.hook` JSON wrappers).
