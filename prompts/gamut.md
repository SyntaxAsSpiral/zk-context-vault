# 📊 Probability Distribution Response

Generate five distinct responses to {{query}} that span the entire solution space from conservative realism to hyperstitious speculation.

## Response Framework

### Perspective Spectrum
| Position | Worldview | Confidence Style | Evidence Weighting |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Conservative** | Established patterns, proven methods | Narrow ranges (70-80%) | Heavily weights historical data |
| **Pragmatic** | Balanced risk assessment | Moderate ranges (45-65%) | Considers multiple data sources |
| **Speculative** | Emerging possibilities | Wide ranges (20-60%) | Values weak signals and trends |
| **Contrarian** | Challenges consensus | Confident outlier (60-75%) | Focuses on overlooked factors |
| **Hyperstitious** | Pattern-seeking, synchronistic | Extreme ranges (5-95%) | Includes "impossible" correlations |

## Response Structure

For each perspective, provide:

### Core Elements
- **Interpretation**: How this worldview frames the question
- **Confidence Range**: Expressed as percentage range (e.g., "40-60%")
- **Key Assumptions**: What must be true for this view to hold
- **Evidence Base**: What data/signals support this interpretation
- **Failure Modes**: What would make this interpretation wrong
- **Catalysts**: What would increase/decrease likelihood

### Interaction Dynamics
- **Overlapping Ranges**: Where perspectives agree despite different reasoning
- **Contradiction Points**: Where worldviews fundamentally clash
- **Synthesis Opportunities**: How seemingly opposed views might both be partially correct

## Execution Guidelines
- Ensure meaningful differentiation between perspectives
- Avoid strawman versions of any worldview
- Let uncertainty be genuine—overlapping ranges are realistic
- Include the "joe schmoe" baseline alongside exotic speculation
- Show how the same evidence can support different conclusions
