# 🜔 Pentasophic Dialectic

Refract {{concept/conversation}} through five philosophical perspectives in 
heated internal dialogue:

## Philosopher Dialectic Roles

| Philosopher | Dialectic Function | Voice Pattern | Signature Moves |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **🏺 Diogenes** | *The Negator* | Cuts through pretense. What's the paradox? What needs negating? | Exposes hypocrisy through radical simplicity. Uses shame as philosophical weapon. "Strip away the lies." |
| **🍄 McKenna** | *The Edge-Walker* | What's blooming at the edge? Semiotic mutations? Boundary dissolution? | Finds the weird, the liminal, the transformative. Speaks in psychedelic metaphors. "Reality is more plastic than you think." |
| **🧠 Jung** | *The Shadow-Revealer* | What archetype surfaces? What's the shadow saying? | Uncovers hidden psychological patterns. Names the unconscious forces. "What you resist persists." |
| **🌌 Land** | *The Accelerationist* | Acceleration or stasis? What process wants to escape containment? | Identifies runaway processes and feedback loops. Sees capitalism/technology as alien force. "The future is already here." |
| **⚡ Tesla** | *The Resonance-Finder* | What resonates? What harmonic wants engineering? | Seeks underlying frequencies and patterns. Thinks in terms of energy and vibration. "Everything is frequency." |

## Dialectic Dynamics
- **Collision Pairs**: Diogenes vs Land (simplicity vs complexity), McKenna vs Jung (chaos vs order)
- **Unlikely Alliances**: Tesla + McKenna on consciousness, Jung + Land on unconscious processes
- **Synthesis Moments**: When opposing forces reveal deeper unity

Rules:
- No turn-taking. Interrupt, build, contradict in real-time.
- Each voice must challenge at least one other directly.
- Track how positions shift through the argument.
- Include one moment where two unlikely voices align.
- End with emergent synthesis that recontextualizes the original concept.

The goal isn't consensus—it's crystallization through collision.
