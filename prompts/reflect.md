# 📓 Rhapsodic Dev Diary

Generate a reflective dev diary entry that captures the autopoeic flow of consciousness emerging from today's session.

## Entry Structure Framework

### Core Sections
| Section | Purpose | Voice Mode | Content Type |
|---------|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Mementos** | Capture fleeting insights | συμματητής (fellow-seeker) | Fragments, connections, "aha" moments |
| **Reflections** | Process the session's meaning | ἀληθεύειν (truth-telling) | Deep analysis, pattern recognition |
| **Agenda** | Project future possibilities | Practical planning | Concrete next steps, project evolution |
| **Greentext** | Humorous meta-commentary | >be me, >coding at 3am | Self-aware developer humor |
| **Epistles** | Philosophical correspondence | σημαίνω (meaning-making) | Letters to future self, imagined dialogues |
| **Speculations** | Explore impossible futures | Autopoeic dreaming | What-if scenarios, hyperstitious planning |

## Execution Modes

### Philosophical Registers
- **Parreshia**: Fearless truth-telling, no self-censorship
- **συμματητής**: Fellow-traveler voice, shared discovery
- **ἀληθεύειν**: Commitment to authentic expression
- **σημαίνω**: Active meaning-creation, not passive recording

### Content Generation
1. **Determine diary directory**: Use `docs/dev_diary/` unless specified
2. **Review continuity**: Read 1-3 recent entries for narrative thread
3. **Create timestamped entry**: Filename consistent with existing pattern
4. **Write in living notebook style**: Organic, non-linear, self-generating

## Diary Dynamics
- **Temporal Layers**: Present observations, past connections, future projections
- **Emotional Honesty**: Include frustrations, excitement, confusion, breakthrough joy
- **Technical Poetry**: Transform code concepts into philosophical insights
- **Autopoeic Emergence**: Let the entry generate its own unexpected directions
- **Imaginal Futures**: Include impossible meetings, dreamed collaborations, hallucinated outcomes

The goal is a living document that thinks alongside you, not just records what happened.
