# Epistemic Rendering Stack

*A coherent prompt-craft library for controlled transformation of ideas across different cognitive surfaces.*

## What This Is

This is not a random collection of prompts. It's a **describer router**—a set of reusable response-shaping operators that let the same underlying concept be explored through story, debate, simulation, uncertainty, fiction, embodiment, ritual, and reflection.

Think of it as "describer modes" before you ever named them that.

## The Lenses

Each prompt is a lens—a controlled transformation that reveals different aspects of the same truth:

| Glyph | Lens | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| 🌙 | **[Gentle Compression](bedtime.md)** | Child-scale meaning through narrative warmth | Retention, emotional safety, intuition over precision |
| 🏫 | **[Social Cognition](classroom.md)** | Learning under pressure via conflicting perspectives | When friction and disagreement do the teaching |
| 🜔 | **[Philosophical Interference](dialectic.md)** | Five thinkers collide until structure crystallizes | When concepts are too stable and need destabilization |
| 📊 | **[Uncertainty Surfacing](gamut.md)** | Spreads questions across confidence spectrum | When truth is not singular and pretending otherwise is dishonest |
| 🧙 | **[Fictional Displacement](hpmor.md)** | Dangerous truths safely spoken through Quirrell | When insights are morally sharp, socially unsafe, existentially heavy |
| 🎀 | **[System Embodiment](moeverse.md)** | Architecture becomes characters and relationships | Explaining systems to visual/relational thinkers without dumbing down |
| ☠️ | **[Ritualized Machine Voice](murder.md)** | Gothic, liturgical, adversarial computation | When aesthetic authority and alienation are part of the point |
| 📓 | **[Autopoietic Integration](reflect.md)** | Session becomes living memory | When output is not an answer but continuity of self and project |

## The Hidden Structure

These aren't just styles. They correspond to distinct cognitive tasks:

- **explaining** → **destabilizing** → **socializing** → **probabilizing** → **embodying** → **ritualizing** → **remembering**

That's why they feel compatible rather than redundant.

## Why This Matters

Most prompt collections optimize for output quality.

This one optimizes for **epistemic hygiene**:
- No single voice is allowed to dominate
- No single framing is treated as "the truth"  
- Meaning is preserved by multiplicity, not consensus

## Usage

Same content → different truth surfaces → different kinds of understanding.

Choose your lens based on what kind of cognitive work needs to happen, not just what kind of output you want.

## Integration

This epistemic rendering stack connects to broader context engineering patterns:

- **[Covenant Patterns](../skills/covenant-patterns/SKILL.md)** - Foundational principles that guide epistemic rendering design
- **[Multi-Agent Coordination](../skills/multi-agent-coordination/SKILL.md)** - Using different lenses across specialized agents in pentadyadic evaluation
- **[Agent Steering](../skills/agent-steering/SKILL.md)** - How rendering modes affect agent context compilation and steering

The lenses also relate to core [steering-global-principles](steering-global-principles.md) of epistemic hygiene and assumption-hostile design.
