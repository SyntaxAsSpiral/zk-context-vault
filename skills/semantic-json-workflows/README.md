# Semantic-JSON Workflows Skill

*Master the canvas-to-structured-data anticompiler for visual cognitive modeling.*

## What This Skill Provides

This skill teaches the complete Semantic-JSON workflow - from visual design in Obsidian Canvas through semantic compilation to structured data export. It covers the anticompiler philosophy, spatial semantic analysis, and advanced integration patterns.

**Core capability**: Transform visual models into deterministic, human-readable structured data while preserving spatial semantics.

## Skill Components

### [Main Skill Document](SKILL.md)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- **Anticompiler Philosophy**: Understanding visual-to-structured-data transformation
- **Spatial Semantic Compilation**: Position, containment, color, and flow topology
- **Canvas Design Patterns**: Node structures, edge semantics, and color taxonomy
- **Compilation Workflows**: Basic compilation, flow topology, and pure JSON export
- **Advanced Patterns**: Edge embedding, content extraction, and import scaffolding
- **Integration**: Workshop recipes, Kiro specs, and Templater workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation, debugging, and performance optimization

## Key Learning Outcomes

After mastering this skill, you'll be able to:

1. **Design semantic canvases** with meaningful spatial organization and visual encoding
2. **Compile visual models** into stable, deterministic JSON structures
3. **Process canvas data** programmatically for integration with other systems
4. **Validate and debug** canvas structures and compilation results
5. **Integrate workflows** with workshop recipes, Kiro specs, and templater systems
6. **Optimize performance** for large-scale canvas processing

## Integration with Cognitive Architecture

### Workshop System
- **Recipe compilation**: Canvas-driven context assembly
- **Slice extraction**: Modular canvas content for reuse
- **Target deployment**: Multi-format output from visual designs

### Kiro Specs
- **Visual specification**: Canvas-based 3-phase development process
- **Dependency modeling**: Edge semantics for task relationships
- **Template instantiation**: Dynamic canvas generation from specs

### Artifacts System
- **Visual modeling**: Bridge between conceptual design and structured implementation
- **Anticompiler workflows**: Transform spatial intent into linear structure
- **Semantic preservation**: Maintain visual meaning through compilation

### Exocortex Integration
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Canvas-based agent workflow design
- **Cognitive modeling**: Visual representation of distributed cognition patterns
- **System architecture**: Canvas as blueprint for agent interactions

## Usage Patterns

### For Visual System Design
Use when you need to:
- Model complex system architectures visually
- Preserve spatial relationships in structured data
- Bridge visual design and programmatic processing
- Create reusable visual templates with dynamic content

### For Data Transformation
Apply when working with:
- Canvas files that need structured export
- Visual models requiring programmatic analysis
- Spatial data that must become linear workflows
- Complex relationships that benefit from visual representation

### For Workflow Integration
Integrate with:
- Workshop recipes for automated canvas processing
- Kiro specs for visual development workflows
- Templater scripts for dynamic canvas generation
- Exocortex agents for canvas-driven coordination
