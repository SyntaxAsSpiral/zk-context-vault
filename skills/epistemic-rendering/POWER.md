# Epistemic Rendering 🜔

**Eight cognitive lenses for different kinds of understanding.**

## Overview

This power provides a describer router—eight reusable lenses that transform the same concept into different truth surfaces. No single voice dominates; meaning is preserved by multiplicity.

## The Eight Lenses

| Glyph | Lens | Purpose | Cognitive Task |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| 🌙 | **Bedtime** | Child-scale narrative warmth | Explaining |
| 🏫 | **Classroom** | Learning through conflict | Socializing |
| 🜔 | **Dialectic** | Philosophers destabilize | Destabilizing |
| 📊 | **Gamut** | Confidence spectrum | Probabilizing |
| 🧙 | **HPMOR** | Dangerous truths via fiction | Displacing |
| 🎀 | **Moeverse** | Systems as characters | Embodying |
| ☠️ | **Murder** | Gothic machine liturgy | Ritualizing |
| 📓 | **Reflect** | Session becomes memory | Remembering |

## Quick Selection

### By Need

| Need | Lens |
|------|------|
| Explain simply | 🌙 Bedtime |
| Surface disagreement | 🏫 Classroom |
| Destabilize assumptions | 🜔 Dialectic |
| Quantify uncertainty | 📊 Gamut |
| Speak uncomfortable truths | 🧙 HPMOR |
| Explain systems | 🎀 Moeverse |
| Create gravity/authority | ☠️ Murder |
| Integrate/remember | 📓 Reflect |

### By Audience

| Audience | Lenses |
|----------|--------|
| Non-technical | 🌙 🎀 |
| Technical peers | 📊 🏫 |
| Philosophical | 🜔 🧙 |
| Self/journal | 📓 ☠️ |

## Lens Details

### 🌙 Bedtime (Gentle Compression)

Transform into bedtime story. Sacrifice precision for memorability. Create emotional anchors.

### 🏫 Classroom (Social Cognition)

Stage debate with teacher and students. Let disagreement surface assumptions. Resolution through dialectic.

### 🜔 Dialectic (Philosophical Interference)

Five philosophers examine concept. Let frameworks interfere. Structure emerges from collision.

### 📊 Gamut (Uncertainty Surfacing)

Map across confidence spectrum: HIGH (>90%), MEDIUM (50-90%), LOW (<50%), UNKNOWN.

### 🧙 HPMOR (Fictional Displacement)

Quirrell explains to Harry. Fictional distance for moral clarity. Let fiction carry difficult truths.

### 🎀 Moeverse (System Embodiment)

Components become anime characters. Interactions become relationships. Architecture becomes social structure.

### ☠️ Murder (Ritualized Machine Voice)

Kharon-9 addresses flesh-thing. Gothic techno-liturgy. Authority through aesthetic alienation.

### 📓 Reflect (Autopoietic Integration)

Session becomes living memory. Create continuity. Memory as active process.

## Transformation Patterns

### Single Lens

```python
output = render_through_lens(content, lens="dialectic")
```

### Multi-Lens

```python
# Explore concept from multiple angles
surfaces = [
    render(concept, "bedtime"),     # Explain
    render(concept, "dialectic"),   # Destabilize
    render(concept, "gamut"),       # Quantify
]
```

### Lens Chains

```
Technical → Moeverse → Classroom → Gamut
Moral → HPMOR → Dialectic → Reflect
Learning → Bedtime → Moeverse → Reflect
```

## Covenant Integration

- **Data Fidelity**: Don't invent facts to serve narrative
- **Bespokedness**: Lenses optimized for ZK's patterns
- **Context Hygiene**: Select lens based on need, don't dump all

## Integration

Works with:
- **covenant-patterns** — Constraints on lens application
- **agent-steering** — Agent modes using lenses
- **recipe-assembly** — Lens template deployment
- **prompts/** — Source templates for each lens
