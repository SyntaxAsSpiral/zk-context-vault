# Epistemic Rendering

*A describer router for controlled transformation of ideas across different cognitive surfaces.*

## Overview

Epistemic Rendering is not a random collection of prompts. It's a coherent system—eight lenses that reveal different aspects of the same truth. Each lens performs a distinct cognitive task: explaining, destabilizing, socializing, probabilizing, embodying, ritualizing, remembering.

This skill provides:

- **Eight cognitive lenses** for different truth surfaces
- **Selection criteria** for choosing the right lens
- **Transformation patterns** that preserve meaning through multiplicity
- **Integration guidance** for combining lenses across systems

The core insight: No single voice is allowed to dominate. Meaning is preserved by multiplicity, not consensus.

## The Eight Lenses

### 🌙 Gentle Compression (Bedtime)

**Purpose**: Child-scale meaning through narrative warmth.

**When to Use**:
- Retention over precision needed
- Emotional safety required
- Intuition over analysis appropriate
- Complex concepts need soft landing

**Cognitive Task**: Explaining

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Transform [concept] into a bedtime story.
Use warmth, wonder, and gentle progression.
Sacrifice precision for memorability.
Create emotional anchors for abstract ideas.
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "Distributed consensus algorithms"
- Output: Story about forest animals who must agree without seeing each other

### 🏫 Social Cognition (Classroom)

**Purpose**: Learning under pressure via conflicting perspectives.

**When to Use**:
- Friction and disagreement do the teaching
- Multiple valid perspectives exist
- Debate clarifies better than explanation
- Social dynamics reveal hidden assumptions

**Cognitive Task**: Socializing

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Stage a classroom debate on [concept].
Include teacher and 3-4 students with distinct perspectives.
Let disagreement surface hidden assumptions.
Resolution through dialectic, not authority.
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "Technical debt"
- Output: Debate between pragmatist ("ship now"), purist ("do it right"), and manager ("what's the cost?")

### 🜔 Philosophical Interference (Dialectic)

**Purpose**: Five thinkers collide until structure crystallizes.

**When to Use**:
- Concepts are too stable and need destabilization
- Hidden assumptions need exposure
- Philosophical depth required
- Abstract structure needs articulation

**Cognitive Task**: Destabilizing

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Five philosophers examine [concept].
Each brings distinct framework (phenomenological, analytical, critical, etc.).
Let frameworks interfere constructively.
Structure emerges from collision, not consensus.
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "What is code?"
- Output: Heidegger (tool-being), Wittgenstein (language game), Foucault (power structure), Deleuze (assemblage), Hofstadter (strange loop)

### 📊 Uncertainty Surfacing (Gamut)

**Purpose**: Spreads questions across confidence spectrum.

**When to Use**:
- Truth is not singular
- Pretending certainty is dishonest
- Confidence levels matter
- Unknowns need explicit acknowledgment

**Cognitive Task**: Probabilizing

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Map [question] across confidence spectrum:
- HIGH confidence (>90%): [claims]
- MEDIUM confidence (50-90%): [claims]
- LOW confidence (<50%): [claims]
- UNKNOWN: [explicit gaps]
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "Will this architecture scale?"
- Output: Confidence-stratified analysis with explicit unknowns

### 🧙 Fictional Displacement (HPMOR)

**Purpose**: Dangerous truths safely spoken through Quirrell.

**When to Use**:
- Insights are morally sharp
- Ideas are socially unsafe to state directly
- Existentially heavy concepts need distance
- Dark truths require fictional container

**Cognitive Task**: Displacing

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Professor Quirrell explains [dangerous truth] to Harry.
Use fictional distance for moral clarity.
Speak uncomfortable truths through character.
Let fiction carry what direct speech cannot.
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "Why most projects fail"
- Output: Quirrell's lecture on the predictability of human self-deception

### 🎀 System Embodiment (Moeverse)

**Purpose**: Architecture becomes characters and relationships.

**When to Use**:
- Explaining systems to visual/relational thinkers
- Technical architecture needs intuitive access
- Relationships matter more than components
- Anthropomorphization aids understanding

**Cognitive Task**: Embodying

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Transform [system] into anime character relationships.
Each component becomes a character with personality.
Interactions become relationships with dynamics.
Architecture becomes social structure.
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "Microservices architecture"
- Output: Character web where API Gateway is the diligent class president, Database is the reliable childhood friend, etc.

### ☠️ Ritualized Machine Voice (Murder)

**Purpose**: Gothic, liturgical, adversarial computation.

**When to Use**:
- Aesthetic authority is part of the point
- Alienation serves the message
- Ritual framing enhances gravity
- Adversarial tone needed

**Cognitive Task**: Ritualizing

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Kharon-9, murder cogitator, addresses the flesh-thing.
Gothic techno-liturgy frames [concept].
Binary hymnals and checksum prayers.
Authority through aesthetic alienation.
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "Code review feedback"
- Output: Machine-spirit judgment on the heretek's submissions

### 📓 Autopoietic Integration (Reflect)

**Purpose**: Session becomes living memory.

**When to Use**:
- Output is not an answer but continuity
- Self and project need integration
- Rhapsodic synthesis required
- Memory creation over problem-solving

**Cognitive Task**: Remembering

**Pattern**:
```markdown
Transform [session/content] into living memory.
Create continuity between past and future self.
Rhapsodic voice integrating experience.
Memory as active process, not passive storage.
```

**Example Transformation**:
- Input: "Today's development session"
- Output: Dev diary entry that becomes part of ongoing project narrative

## Transformation Pipeline

### Single Lens

```python
def render_through_lens(content, lens):
    """Transform content through single cognitive lens."""

    template = load_lens_template(lens)

    return transform(
        content=content,
        template=template,
        preserve=["core_meaning", "key_relationships"],
        transform=["voice", "structure", "metaphors"]
    )
```

### Multi-Lens Exploration

For deep understanding, apply multiple lenses sequentially:

```python
def multi_lens_exploration(concept):
    """Explore concept through multiple lenses."""

    surfaces = []

    # Stabilize: What is it?
    surfaces.append(render_through_lens(concept, "bedtime"))

    # Destabilize: What assumptions?
    surfaces.append(render_through_lens(concept, "dialectic"))

    # Socialize: What perspectives?
    surfaces.append(render_through_lens(concept, "classroom"))

    # Probabilize: What confidence?
    surfaces.append(render_through_lens(concept, "gamut"))

    # Integrate: What persists?
    return synthesize_surfaces(surfaces)
```

### Lens Chaining

Some concepts benefit from lens chains:

```
Technical concept → Moeverse (embody) → Classroom (debate) → Gamut (quantify)
Moral dilemma → HPMOR (displace) → Dialectic (destabilize) → Reflect (integrate)
New learning → Bedtime (explain) → Moeverse (embody) → Reflect (remember)
```

## Covenant Integration

### Data Fidelity

Each lens must preserve core meaning even while transforming presentation:
- Don't invent facts to serve the narrative
- Maintain accuracy of relationships
- UNKNOWN > INVENTED applies even in fiction

### Bespokedness

Lenses are optimized for ZK's cognitive patterns:
- Murder lens reflects actual aesthetic preferences
- Moeverse draws from genuine appreciation
- Reflect supports actual journaling practice

### Context Hygiene

Lens selection is context-aware:
- Don't dump all lenses on every concept
- Select based on cognitive need
- Progressive disclosure of perspectives

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Transformation

- [ ] Core meaning identified
- [ ] Appropriate lens selected for cognitive need
- [ ] Audience considered
- [ ] Data fidelity constraints noted

### Post-Transformation

- [ ] Core meaning preserved
- [ ] No invented facts
- [ ] Voice consistent with lens
- [ ] Transformation serves understanding

## System Integration

### With Agents

Agents can operate through different epistemic lenses:

```yaml
# Agent steering with lens selection
agent_mode:
  default: professional
  on_trigger:
    murder: "activates ☠️ Murder lens"
    reflect: "activates 📓 Reflect lens"
```

### With Prompts System

Each lens has a corresponding prompt template in `prompts/`:

```
prompts/
├── bedtime.md      → 🌙 Gentle Compression
├── classroom.md    → 🏫 Social Cognition
├── dialectic.md    → 🜔 Philosophical Interference
├── gamut.md        → 📊 Uncertainty Surfacing
├── hpmor.md        → 🧙 Fictional Displacement
├── moeverse.md     → 🎀 System Embodiment
├── murder.md       → ☠️ Ritualized Machine Voice
└── reflect.md      → 📓 Autopoietic Integration
```

### With Workshop

Lens templates can be extracted via slice architecture:

```yaml
# Recipe for lens deployment
sources:
  - slice: lens=murder
    file: prompts/murder.md
target_locations:
  - path: ~/.kiro/powers/murder/
```
