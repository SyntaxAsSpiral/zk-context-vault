# Product Overview

**zk-context-vault** is ZK's personal context library and agent configuration vault—an Obsidian-based cognitive infrastructure for AI agent configuration, context management, and knowledge work.

## Core Purpose

Transform AI coding agents from simple assistants into cognitive partners through:
- **Explicit context management** via steering rules and modular assembly
- **Structured development** using spec-driven workflows (Requirements → Design → Tasks)
- **Reusable capabilities** packaged as Agent Skills and Kiro Powers
- **Multi-agent coordination** through the Exocortex pentadyadic architecture

## Key Systems

1. **Covenant Principles** - Anti-assumption framework preventing presumptive behavior
2. **Agent Configurations** - Universal patterns for Kiro, Claude Code, Codex, Charm
3. **Skills Library** - Technical capabilities with dual-format deployment (SKILL.md + POWER.md)
4. **Workshop System** - Recipe-based assembly and deployment of context documentation
5. **Exocortex** - Advanced multi-agent coordination patterns
6. **Epistemic Rendering** - Multiple cognitive lenses for concept exploration

## Philosophy

**Bespoke-first design**: Optimized for operator workflow over enterprise patterns. When software is disposable (rewrite < refactor), optimize for beauty and razor-sharp function over long-term maintainability.

**Assumption-hostile**: Every component explicitly guards against assumptions. UNKNOWN > INVENTED. Missing information triggers queries rather than presumptive behavior.

**Work preservation**: Nothing gets lost. Changes are explicit and reversible. "Out of scope" triggers questions, not automatic cleanup.
